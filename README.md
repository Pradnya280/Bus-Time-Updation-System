# Bus-Time-Updation-System

# Problem Statement :
1. Many times( in rural areas also) , MSRTC buses doesn’t reach on time at station . So unnecessarily , passenger have to wait until bus reach and also other users can’t get 
the updates of the current or upcoming buses.
2. To avoid these situation and save user’s and passenger’s valuable time , we’ve created such a platform , that will convey the updation message to user and passenger and they’ll
get the convenient bus.

# Objectives :

1. This platform will convey the updation message to the user and passenger at any time and anywhere .
2. This system will help to look up for the upcoming  buses by convenience  of user. 
3. User can choose what bus they’ll prefer by checking time – slot which will be provided by this system.
4. User can search for the required buses by any entity ( starting station , ending station, Time , Bus no., etc.)
